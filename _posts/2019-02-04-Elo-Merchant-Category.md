Elo is one of the largest payment brands in Brazil. In this competition on kaggle, we are provided data of purchasing history each customer ID and the payment information of that customer.Here we are going to figure out how to use the avalible information in raw data to predict the loyalty of a customer, thus the company can focus their customer service resources on more important customers.

# Data PreProcessing

First let's deal with the transaction data `new_merchant_transactions.csv` and `historical_transactions.csv` .  

- Load the data

  ```python
  #TODO: load dataframeas here
  ```

- Binarize the data

  ```python
  # TODO: binarize data
  ```

- Format the data

  ```python
  # TODO: Format the date
  ```
