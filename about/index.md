<center>Hi there !</center>
<center>This is Tianqi (Bruce) Yang, a data analysist, programer and physics engineer.</center>
    <center>I am currently a graduate student majored in Computer Science at University of Rochester. </center></p>
<p><center>
  In the previous summer, I was an intern in the <strong>Google Summer of Code</strong> program and worked in the open-source organization of <strong>AIMA</strong>(Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach). I implemented the classic machine learning and deep learning algorithms in Python as well as their demonstration cases in Jupyter notebook. I contributed more than 15000 lines of code to the organization.
